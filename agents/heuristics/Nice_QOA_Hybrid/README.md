This was the first attempt at hardcoding (i.e not using ML or RL) a hybrid agent.

When located in level 0, this agent uses the NiceQOA strategy of always offering the best price for the opponent.

When in level 1, this agent uses the default QOA strategy

Regarding performance, this agent is somewhat mediocre (again, this is only based on the agent environments that I've checked it in).
If I recall correctly, this agent usually performs the worst amongst the hybrid agents here in the repository.
