This is a form of the QuantityOrientedAgent (the winner from the last competition) with a small change in behavior to be greedier.

Rather than accepting any offer for less quantity than we need, only accept offers that are at our best price.

Otherwise, reject the offer and record the quantity offered (if it's an amount we're happy with). Counteroffer by asking for the same quantity they proposed, but at our best price.



In the tournaments I've checked this agent in, it tends to perform poorly.
