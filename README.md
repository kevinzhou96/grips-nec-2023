# g-RIPS Sendai 2023 - NEC Team 
This is the GitHub Repo for the g-RIPS Sendai 2023 NEC Project on Automated Reasoning for Supply Chain Management.

In this project, we implement several negotiating agents for the ANAC Supply Chain Management League (SCML), as well as some utility scripts to aid in agent development and analysis. 

# Agents
Our agents are broken into two categories. 
The first category consists of agents which are based on various heuristics.
These agents are:
- GreedyQOA
- HalfGreedyQOA
- NiceQOA
- Nice/QOA hybrid
- Half-desperate/Half-greedy hybrid
- QOA/Half-greedy hybrid

The second category consists of agents which partly or wholly use reinforcement learning to determine their strategies. 
These agents are:
- RLAgent-v0 (a family of pure RL agents)
- 

The team consists of:
- Isaac Brown (The Ohio State University)
- Soto Hisakawa (Kyushu University)
- Soichiro Sato (Musashino University)
- Kevin Zhou (University of Illinois at Chicago)

This project was conducted under the supervision of:
- Academic mentor: Dr. Masaki Ogawa (Tohoku University)
- Industry mentor: Dr. Yasser Mohammad (NEC)
